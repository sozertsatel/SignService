# SignService — Digital Signature Tool

[Русский](README.md) | **English**

A desktop application (C# / [Avalonia UI](https://avaloniaui.net/)) for signing
documents with electronic signatures (CMS/PKCS#7) and working with signature
files. The signing logic is ported from the ReportGGE document-signing service
and targets the Russian GOST cryptography ecosystem (CryptoPro CSP), while
plain RSA/ECDSA certificates work as well.

**Download:** a ready-to-run `SignService.exe` (Windows x64, no .NET required)
is published on the [Releases](https://github.com/zaynullinmi/SignService/releases) page.

## Features

### Signing

- **Drag & drop** files or whole folders into the window, add via a file
  browser, batch signing with a per-file status; file paths are also accepted
  as command-line arguments ("Open with");
- **detached** signature (`name.sig` next to the document — the format required
  by government portals) or **attached** (document embedded in the `.sig`);
- **CAdES-BES by default**: signed attributes signing-time and
  signing-certificate-v2 (RFC 5035, protects against certificate substitution);
  for GOST-2012 certificates certHash is computed with Streebog — a managed
  GOST R 34.11-2012 implementation validated against RFC 6986 test vectors;
- optional **timestamp (CAdES-T)**: a trusted timestamp from an RFC 3161 TSA
  (URL is configurable); for GOST signatures the TSA request is hashed with
  Streebog;
- **GOST via CryptoPro**: on Windows signatures are created through native
  CryptoAPI (`CryptSignMessage`) — the certificate's CSP (CryptoPro CSP for
  GOST) performs the operation and prompts for the container PIN when needed;
  the hash OID is selected by key type (GOST R 34.10-2012 256/512,
  34.10-2001, RSA/ECDSA);
- the **full certificate chain** is embedded into each signature (for offline
  verification) and cached per certificate for batch signing.

### Co-signing and verification

- other people's signatures are **merged with yours into a single `.sig`**
  with multiple signers: automatically with an existing `name.sig` next to the
  document (can be turned off), via the "＋.sig" button, or by dropping
  a signature file onto the window;
- re-signing with the same certificate **replaces** your previous signature
  instead of duplicating it;
- every merged signature is **cryptographically verified**, including the
  document digest, signature value and CAdES certificate binding. Damaged
  signatures and signatures over another revision are excluded; unverifiable
  signers are explicitly reported;
- input signatures are accepted in DER/BER (including indefinite lengths and
  trailing bytes) and base64/PEM.

### Tools (no signature created)

- **Verify signature…** — per-signer CMS/CAdES verification for GOST-2001,
  GOST-2012 256/512, RSA and ECDSA without CryptoPro. Select the original for
  a detached signature; attached signatures use the embedded document.
  Copy or export the detailed report to TXT;
- **Merge .sig…** — combine several signature files into one containing all
  signers (attached containers are accepted; the embedded document is kept);
- **Extract from .sig…** — pull out of a container: the embedded document
  (byte-exact), a detached signature with all signers, and individual `.sig`
  files per signer (signer names in the file names);
- **Build container…** — pack a document together with its existing
  signatures into an attached `.sig` (the inverse of extraction);
- **Stamp PDF…** — save a stamped copy of a document without signing.

### Machine-readable power of attorney (MChD)

- the "Add power of attorney…" button works like Kontur: pick the MChD XML
  (EMCHD_1 format) and the head's signature (.sig; a neighbouring
  `name.xml.sig` is picked up automatically);
- the app verifies the head's signature using the certificate public key,
  checks the validity period and matches the
  representative in the MChD matches the selected certificate by INN/SNILS;
- when signing, the MChD files (XML + .sig) are copied next to the signed
  document (the MChD is NOT embedded into the CMS signature — Kontur does
  the same), and the visual PDF stamp gains a
  "Acting under power of attorney No. …" line;
- the power of attorney is remembered and re-validated on every signing.

### Visual stamp on PDF

- a "DOCUMENT SIGNED WITH ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE" box on the last page:
  certificate number, owner, validity period, optionally the signing date and
  an **organization logo** (PNG/JPEG);
- by default the **original** file is signed, and the stamped copy
  `name (stamped).pdf` is a separate **unsigned** file recreated after every
  signing with **all signers** of the resulting signature (safe for
  co-signing — the stamp never invalidates other signatures);
- a separate checkbox enables the "sign the stamped copy" mode (stamp before
  signing) for recipients that require the signature over the stamped file.

### Certificates

- certificate picker from the "Current User → Personal" store, expired-cert
  filter, the selection is remembered;
- **save a certificate to this computer** (💾 button) to sign without the
  hardware token:
  - "inside the app" — a password-protected PFX visible only to SignService;
  - "into the Windows store" — a copy of the key is installed into the system
    store so **other applications** (CryptoARM, browsers, etc.) can sign too;
    works for token certificates as well (export + install in one step);
  - the app shows an **explicit warning** about the reduced security; removal
    via the 🗑 button (the PFX is wiped; only store entries installed by the
    app can be removed); non-exportable keys cannot be saved — that is
    a token/CA restriction.

### Miscellaneous

- an **operation log window** with timestamps;
- an **About window**: version, author contacts, changelog, update check;
- **auto-update**: new releases are checked on GitHub Releases at startup
  (can be disabled) and installed in one click from the About window (Windows).

### Trust, revocation and timestamps

The report separates document integrity, signature value, certificate binding,
certificate trust, revocation and TSA results. An embedded root never creates
trust: anchors come from OS root stores and explicitly selected CA certificates.
BouncyCastle verifies certificate-chain, CRL and OCSP signatures without a CSP.

Verification is offline by default. It uses embedded CRLs and selected `.crl`/
`.ocsp` files; HTTP(S) CRL/OCSP requests require the network checkbox. Revocation
is checked for every chain certificate except the trust anchor. Missing, stale,
unverifiable or partial evidence (including delta/indirect CRLs) gives an unknown
status. Missing intermediate certificates must be embedded in the CMS or in OS
intermediate stores.

The signer's `signing-time` does not prove when a signature was created.
Historical certificate validity is assessed only using a TSA timestamp whose
imprint, signature, trust and required revocation checks passed. TSA responses
also must match the request and nonce.

MChD verification re-reads current files, verifies and copies the same XML/SIG
snapshot. Conflicting destination files stop signing before the signature is
saved. Cryptographic verification does not establish the head's authority,
the scope of delegated powers or MChD registry revocation; missing assurances
are reported as warnings.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11 — the self-contained exe from the Releases page;
- to **create** GOST signatures — **CryptoPro CSP** installed with a personal
  certificate;
- verifying and merging GOST signatures requires **no CryptoPro** on Windows/Linux/macOS;
- building from source: .NET 8 SDK (Windows/Linux/macOS; outside Windows
  signing is limited to platform algorithms — RSA/ECDSA; GOST requires
  the CSP on Windows).

## Build and run

```bash
dotnet build SignService.sln -c Release
dotnet run --project src/SignService
dotnet run --project tests/SignService.Tests -c Release   # tests
```

On a personal workstation append `-- --skip-user-store` to the test command to
skip scenarios that change user certificate stores or application data. CI runs
the full suite in an isolated runner. Managed GOST, CRL/OCSP and TSA verification
tests run without CryptoPro or OpenSSL.

Publishing the self-contained exe:

```bash
dotnet publish src/SignService -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true \
  -p:PublishSingleFile=true \
  -p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true \
  -p:EnableCompressionInSingleFile=true \
  -o publish
```

## Usage

1. Start the app — certificates with a private key appear in the drop-down.
2. Pick a certificate and the signature mode; optionally enable the timestamp
   and/or the PDF stamp.
3. Drag files into the window (or use the browser) and press **Sign** —
   a `name.sig` appears next to each file.
4. Operations on existing signatures live in the **Tools** menu.

The change history is in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) (Russian) and in the
About window.
